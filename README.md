We would like you to set up a basic platform using Laravel 8 that has a login system and a profile page for an individual user.

The system should require the user to login/register and from there,  display a profile based off the username theyâ€™ve set up.

This will require use of a relational database.


Please can you create something and push it up to a git repo that we can then view?

It would also be great to see a video of it working.
